Artificial life 2.0

All dots are agents with a neural net, these agants can eat eachother and reproduce asexually, 
they can see along a line of sight, rotate, and move up,down,left,right respective to their angle.
The connections of the neural net are saved as dna and passed on with mutation to the offspring.
The colors represent relatives, the colors randomly diverge as mutation from the ancestor increases.
around 500 are created, there is no health input meaning they can only reproduce as they eat others.

This code is written in c++ with sdl and sdl_ttf
these libraries are used to display the spheres only.
